    # **What will it take for the world to see that now more than ever we’re all the frontline of global health?**

    \##

    ## *I walked away from working on this film with a deep understanding that what I do affects the people around me, everyone from loved ones to passers-by. I could sit next to a child, a grandmother, a man undergoing cancer treatment and give them the flu (or any other disease) and hospitalize or kill them without even knowing it. Each of us have a role to play, and it won’t work unless we all contribute.*

In the 21st century, we are all connected. Population growth, mass urbanization, deforestation, climate change and increased travel have dramatically increased the risk that familiar diseases will spread and mutate, and new ones will emerge. As people enter new spheres of biodiversity, they come into closer contact with other species, increasing the risk of viruses jumping from animals to humans, and then spreading more widely.

Unseen Enemy is an essential exploration into the increasing threat of emerging infectious disease outbreaks and their impacts on society. Meet healthcare workers, disease detectives and families who have experienced the horror and devastation of Ebola, Zika and Influenza epidemics and emerged deeply changed.

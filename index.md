**In the 21st century, we are all connected...**

Population growth, mass urbanization, deforestation, climate change and increased travel have dramatically increased the risk that familiar diseases will spread and mutate, and new ones will emerge. As people enter new spheres of biodiversity, they come into closer contact with other species, allowing viruses to jump from from animals to humans and then spread more widely.

Unseen Enemy is an essential exploration into the increasing threat of emerging infectious disease outbreaks and their societal impacts. Meet healthcare workers, disease detectives and families who have experienced the horror and devastation of Ebola, Zika and Influenza epidemics and emerged deeply changed. Watch the official trailer below and scroll further for events, screenings and to follow the stories in our impact campaign **It Takes All of Us**.
